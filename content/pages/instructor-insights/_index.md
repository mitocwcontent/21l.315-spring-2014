Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _21L.315 Prizewinners: Nobelistas_ as it was taught by senior lecturer Wyn Kelley in Spring 2014.

This course, worth six instead of the typical twelve credits, drew attention to the thirteen female Nobel laureates, or Nobelistas, in Literature. We read novels or stories by five fiction writers—Gordimer, Morrison, Lessing, Müller, and Munro—with particular attention to narrative patterns in the texts, the socio-historical context of each writer, and critical reception of these works. Questions about how the Nobel Prize functions and is understood and about how Literature relates to the other Nobel subject areas—Peace, Chemistry, Physics, Medicine, Economic Sciences—featured in our discussions, too.

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly undergraduates, with one or two graduate students.

### Breakdown by Major

Students were from many different departments.

### Typical Student Background

The class included both sophisticated literature students and students who hadn’t taken many literature classes before _Prizewinners: Nobelistas_. Several of the sophisticated students acted as leaders and encouraged others to participate.

The class typically includes students who speak English as a second language or who have not grown up in the United States. In Spring 2014, some students were from central European countries and could identify with the politics in Müller’s _The Appointment_. Some students identified as Latina/o and responded strongly to the stories about leaving one’s country, losing one’s identity, or speaking a different language. They noted that they took the class because it gave them an opportunity to connect with ideas that they weren’t able to talk about in their other classes.

### Enrollment Cap

Enrollment is limited to 20-25 students so as to allow for interactive seminar discussions and one-on-one conferences between the instructor and students.
